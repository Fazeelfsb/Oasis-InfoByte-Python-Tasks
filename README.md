# BMI Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using Python‚Äôs `Tkinter` library. The application allows users to input their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and classifies it into categories such as **Underweight**, **Normal weight**, **Overweight**, or **Obesity**.

## Features

- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with `Tkinter`.
- Input fields for weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Displays the calculated BMI and provides classification.
- Handles errors for invalid input (e.g., negative values or non-numeric inputs).
- Stores and prints historical BMI data for demonstration.

## How to Use

1. **Install Python:**  
   Make sure Python is installed on your system.

2. **Clone this repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fazeelfsb/Oasis-InfoByte-Python-Tasks.git
cd Oasis-InfoByte-Python-Tasks
